# MCP 9.19 - Unofficial
This allows you to easily create a Minecraft Client for the version 1.8.9.

Execute decompile.bat/decompile.sh depending on your operating system.
When done (error) open the project in Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea.

Note: You will have to change a file - `/src/net/minecraft/world/gen/structure/StructureMineshaftPieces.java` - in line 611 replace `lvt_5_1_` with `k`. (Fix planned)
